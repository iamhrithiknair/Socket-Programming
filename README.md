In Simple_Chat_Interface, the user would get to try out a simple chat application using GUI tools like JAVA Swing. This code allows the user you to develop a simple version of chat application. When typing "bye" at client side, both the interfaces quits after a 3 sec lag.

Open separate terminals for each Server & Client to run the chat application
Headsup : Always start the server first
Incase you get an "ArrayIndexError" while trying to run the client - then run it using localhost, i.e, "java Client localhost" after compilin
